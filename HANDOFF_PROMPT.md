This is the continuation of a project that was started with a previous AI agent. The full project context has been documented in a handoff file.

**Please start by doing the following:**

1. Read `HANDOFF.md` at the project root — it contains the complete project context: vision, architecture, current state, known issues, user preferences, and next steps.
2. Read the `README.md` for the project overview.
3. Skim the repository structure and key files listed in the "Key Files to Read First" section of the handoff.
4. Review the git log (`git log --oneline`) to understand the commit history and what's been done.
5. Check the "Known Issues" and "Immediate Next Steps" sections — that's where we left off.

**Important context:**
- [Briefly describe where you left off, e.g., "We just finished v0.1.1 bug fixes but haven't tested end-to-end yet"]
- [Any urgent issues, e.g., "The app builds but audio hasn't been confirmed working"]
- [Your priorities, e.g., "I'd like to focus on getting sound working before moving to new features"]

**About me:**
- [Your experience level, e.g., "I'm not a professional developer — please give clear terminal instructions"]
- [Preferences, e.g., "I use Obsidian for notes, so markdown docs should be Obsidian-compatible"]
- [Anything else the AI should know about how you like to work]

**Branch:** [e.g., `claude/feature-branch-name`]

Please confirm you've reviewed everything, summarize your understanding of where the project stands, and then let's pick up where we left off.
